# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer:
  "git" is a command used in terminal when the command is in reference to pushing or pulling files from "Github".

Github is a tool/program used by programers to store code that may be accessed by other programers.

Researched answer:
GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that allows you to access, manage and retrieve repositories. It's great for companies that use para-coding as it allows for developers to create code in separate branches and merge them into a main repository.
GIT stands for Geospatial Information Technology. It was created in 2005 and is one of the most widely used control systems. GIT works well on multiple operating systems and can create a working repository out of any working copy of code.  


2. What types of evaluations will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: True or false questions

  Researched answer:
  Booleans are a conditional statement in Javascript that will return a "True" or "False" value.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer:
  An index: in reference to a location in the statement or number
  A value: the value will give you the equated value of the number or statement

  Researched answer:
Values are defined by the outcome of the variables created in code. An index will return the location of a character or number with in a variable.


4. What is a built-in method?

  Your answer:
  A built in method is a pre-coded command embedded within a code language or code editor.  

  Researched answer:
Javascript contains what we refer to as "primitive data types." Some of these values include booleans, numbers, strings and null.  These are all built-in methods that coders have embedded into the Javascript coding language to save from having to type out lines of code.


5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer:
  Proper "pair programming" techniques include a driver: a person willing to write code, and a navigator: a person who can guide the driver into executing proper functions. It takes patience, a sharp eye for any spelling or errors in symbols,  good communication skill, and strong perseverance to pair program. It is also good form to switch rolls so both members can have a fresh outlook from a different perspective.

6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer:
  It is truly hard to pick one thing that I found helpful in class this week. However, I have to say that being the navigator for pair programing has helped me to understand concepts better than any other form of learning that took place for me this week. Having to explain methods to my partners and research solutions have embedded most of the information I've retained thus far.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Iteration:
An iteration is a command that repeats on a loop while the the condition remains true. It will cease if or once the condition is false.

2. Higher Order Functions:
Are functions that can take in an array and using built in methods like iterations or loops it will output another function or return argument.

3. Jest:
Jest looks like a coding editor that was created by facebook that you can plug your code into and run for bugs.

4. Objects:
Are the combination of data and function.  

5. Classes:
Classes are the casing for Objects, they contain both data and function.
